# Audio Summarization For Podcasts

_Aneesh Vartakavi, Amanmeet Garg, Zafar Rafii_, Gracenote

This page contains audio and visual examples from our paper titled, *Audio Summarization for Podcasts*.

> We propose a novel system for automatically generating audio summaries for podcasts, allowing listeners to have quick previews of podcast episodes. The proposed system first transcribes the audio from a podcast using automatic speech recognition (ASR), then summarizes the transcript using automatic extractive summarization, and finally returns the audio associated with the text summary. Motivated by a lack of datasets for this task, we created our own by transcribing the audio from various podcasts and summarizing the transcripts using a manual annotation tool. Using these text summaries, we fine-tuned a recent Transformer-based summarization model to specifically handle podcast summaries. Our system achieves ROUGE-(1/2/L) F-scores of 0.63/0.53/0.63, respectively, showing good performance for podcast summarization.
