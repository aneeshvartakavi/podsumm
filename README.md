# Audio Summarization For Podcasts

_Aneesh Vartakavi, Amanmeet Garg, Zafar Rafii_, Gracenote

This page contains audio and visual examples from our paper titled, *Audio Summarization for Podcasts*.

> We propose a method to automatically generate audio summaries for podcasts to allow users to quickly listen to a preview of the content. The proposed method first transcribes the audio from the podcast into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR), then summarizes the transcript using extractive summarization, and finally returns the audio associated with the text summary. Motivated by a lack of datasets for this task, we created our own by transcribing the audio from various podcasts and summarizing the transcripts using a manual annotation tool. We then used these text summaries to fine-tune a recent Transformer-based text summarization model to specifically handle podcast summaries. Our method achieves automatic summarization ROUGE-(1/2/l) scores of 0.63/0.53/0.63, showing promising performance for podcast summarization.
